### Hi there 👋

I'm André, frontend developer 👨‍💻️ at [Finnet](https://finnet.com.br).

JavaScript is my main language. I've been creating apps for the last three years. My focus is React and React Native and in the last few years I started fiddling with, Electron and Bash scripts (but also Product Management, Product Growth, UX/UI...).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a few personal projects (I hope launch it up asap! 😅️)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything and everything about Javascript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Next, Node, DevOps, Serverless and much more
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything cool and fun in the open-source Javascript world
- 💬 Ask me about anything
- 📫 Let's talk on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/andrenespolon)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can build anything with Lego
